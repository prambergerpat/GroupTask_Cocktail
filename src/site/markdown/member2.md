## What parts did I implement?

First I set up our project and copied the provided Framework to it and pushed it to our remote repository.
I also configured our pom.xml correctly and added my personal details.

In the branch queue, I implemented the remove and peek methods in the DrinkQueue class.

In the branch javadoc, I added comments for the classes DrinkQueue and Drink.

In the branch tests, I wrote tests for the classes DrinkQueue, StringQueue and Drink.

In the branch maven_site I added this short documentation of what parts of our project I implemented.
